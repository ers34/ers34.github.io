  <h3>All the perks of pet ownership without all the commitment… no leash attached.</h3>
  <p>At TheraPup our passion for pets always goes the extra mile for our users to experience a taste of pet ownership. We understand that most people are in situations where they cannot be a pet owner so we’ve created a way to experience a pet’s love and care through a therapeutic scheduling method without any long term commitment.</p>

    <h3>How It Works</h3>
    <img src="diagram.png" tile=diagram alt="diagram">
    <p>We connect you with your local shelter and pair you with a furry friend that you can spend time with from 15 mins to 1 hour. You get to enjoy their company, help them socialize, and relieve some of the stress that shelters already have to deal with. All we ask for in return is a small donation to that shelter.</p>

    <h4>Our team understands the therapeutic effects a pet has on an owner and we want to help share that love and care with those who do not have the opportunity to have a pet in their own household.</h4>
